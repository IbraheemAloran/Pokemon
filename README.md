# Pokemon Arena

Pokemon arena is a pokemon battle simulator for Windows machines similar to Pokemon showdown built using JavaFx.
Sprites from Pokemon Black 2/White 2 are used and battle calculations are based on the original calculations in the game with
some minor differences, such as not accounting for some modifiers. 

Currently only 2-player matches on the smae PC are supported, but in the future we hope to implement AI players and playing
with two PC's through a LAN connection.
